# KegScale
A Keg tracking system that monitors weight

Right now the arduino zeros the scale when it turns on and subracts the weight of 5 gallon corny kegs for you but because of this, you need to turn the device on before putting your kegs on the pressure plates. I wasn't able to get the manually hardcoded offset to work, the tare on startup is far more reliable.
